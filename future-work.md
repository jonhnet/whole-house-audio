# Future Ambitions

* Rebuild the snapcast/HiFiBerry player devices from Debian so they can

    * run other software

    * have their installation be more completely automated like the Bluetooth listener

* Complete automation of installation for the Bluetooth listener. Move all the
  manual work into some file on the SD card that runs automatically on pi boot.

* Build a pi-only version of the system. One of the playback devices also
  acts as the snapcast & mpd server and bluetooth listener.
  Stuff a USB stick in there and there's plenty of capacity to
  store a music library.
  This would allow the construction of an entire self-contained system
  without presuming any home server components.
